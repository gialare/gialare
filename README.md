### Hi, 😀

I am a PhD Candidate at Monash University 🇦🇺 and the University of Zurich 🇨🇭.

My research focuses on applying AI and Machine Learning to critical global health challenges. 
In my PhD project, I am developing predictive models to understand the complex dynamics of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) at the intersection of climate change and public health in vulnerable communities. 💻 🦠 🧑🏼‍🔬

I'm passionate about our planet and using deep learning to translate complex, multi-modal data into actionable scientific insights.
I believe in interdisciplinary and international collaboration to solve the big problems and make the solutions more robust and useful for real world applications. 🤝 🌍
